# 7.02 Activity 1

In this exercise, you will use `files_for_activities/learningSet.csv` file. This is the same file you used in the activities in 7.01 section.

Use the method `value_counts` on the columns `MAILCODE`, `NOEXCH`, and `MDMAUD` and check the proportion of category representation in those columns. Since there is a huge imbalance in the representation of category/categories, we will remove this column. Add those columns to the `drop_list`.
