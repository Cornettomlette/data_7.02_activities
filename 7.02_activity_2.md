# 7.02 Activity 2

Keep using the same file.

- Replace null values in the columns `DATASRCE` and `GEOCODE2`.
- Remove the columns starting with `ADATE_`. We are assuming that the date when the previous mail was done is not significant in the respondents decision to give donation. They may or may not even remember when they received the mail in the previous years. And for the column `ADATE_2`, check the values in the column. If the values are pretty much the same, then remove this column as well.
